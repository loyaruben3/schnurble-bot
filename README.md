# schnurble-bot

A little bit about Schnurble Bot, it originally started off as a personal project (well it still is) of me just learning how a discord bot works with discord.py, then it evolved to me deciding to use this bot as a bot version of a mascot of a streamer I mod for on Twitch and just some basic commands that I learned while working on that. I update the commands with new things that I learn every now and then as I take on learning more about discord.py at my own pace
